The snake game

Press any of the keys <W,A,S,D> to start playing;
Press 'p' to pause the game and 'q' to quit the game at any time;
When game is over, the player's score is shown, and the player can press 'r' to restart the game, or 'q' to quit the game.

Rules:
  eat the fruit that is populated randomly to increase your score, which is shown at left bottom corner;
  use the gap between borders to travel to the other side of the screen;
  game is over if it eats itself or hit the border or the middle obstacle;
  
Control: 
  use <W,A,S,D> to go up, left, down, right, respectively.

Enhancements: 
  1. For every 10 points that the player scored, the speed of the snake will increase (until a certain max playable speed) in order to make the game more challenging.
  2. Borders are created with a gap on each side of the screen that allows the snake to go through to get to the other side of the screen, middle obstacle is also created 
      that the snake must avoid.
  
Development environement: 
  the game is designed in C++ and Xlib, running on Linux environment, compiled and tested with g++ 14.
  
Note: 
  Since I added the feature of increasing the speed as game goes on, the initial speed might be slower than usual, but still playable.
